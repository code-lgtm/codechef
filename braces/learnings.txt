-----------------------------Problem Statement-----------------------------
Write a program to validate if the input string has redundant braces?
Return 0/1 
 0 -> NO 1 -> YES 

Input will be always a valid expression

and operators allowed are only + , * , - , /

Example:

((a+b)) has redundant braces so answer will be 1
(a + (a + b)) doesn't have have any redundant braces so answer will be 0
-----------------------------Problem Statement-----------------------------

Solution Approach:
1) Allocate a stack. Array based stack
2) Define and implement its API isEmpty() ,push(), pop(), getTop(), getSecondTop()
3) Loop through input string charcter by character
   -----  If character is other then '}' , ']' or '}' put in stack
   ----- If character is one of '}' , '}' or ']' 
           --- Check if top of stack or next top element is a matching opening bracket
               -- return 1 indicating redundant braces
           --- if not pop from stack till matching opening brace if found
5) If we have reached the end of string, input expressions doesn't have redundant braces, return 0
